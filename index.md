# Industry Data
   What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?
The job titles for our group’s ideal jobs are Business Analyst, IT Project Manager, Data Science and Cloud system engineer.
Business Analysts play a crucial part in assisting organizations with fixing obsolete cycles and implementing new technology. They are sought after in each space of business, from money to IT to corporate administration. As data collection increases and innovation keeps on creating, the job of the IT business analyst is extending also. Job descriptions are developing beyond IT and software to include business components with the ability to focus on the strategy aspect of their roles – and this transition presents a spike in career opportunities. The Bureau of Labour Statistics gauges the requirement for business analysts to rise 14% by 2024. Hence, they are in demand by employers (5 In-Demand Career Paths for Business Analysts, 2021).
IT Project Manager is a popular career in the IT field. IT project managers plan, sort out, and coordinate cross-practical data innovation projects that are huge in degree and effect. They organize the works by other IT experts and administrative staff to deliver another new arrangement of programming. Job projection is expected to increase up to 9% by 2026, according to The Bureau of Labour Statistics. Even today, big companies are in search of IT project managers (5 In-Demand Career Paths for Business Analysts, 2021).
Data Science is one of the most highly paid jobs and is said to be the ‘sexiest job of the 21st century’.  Data Scientists make an average of $116,100 per year. This makes Data Science a highly lucrative career option. Data Science is the investigation of data. It is tied in with removing, dissecting, picturing, overseeing and putting away information to create insights. These bits of knowledge assist the organizations with settling on incredible data driven choices. Jobs for Data Scientists will always be in high demand as long as there is IT in any organization (Gour, 2019).
A cloud engineer is an IT professional liable for any innovative obligations related with cloud computing, including configuration, planning, management, maintenance and backing.  Employers that recruit cloud engineers are regularly hoping to convey cloud benefits or expand their cloud comprehension and innovation and implement them in their organisations. Big companies like Amazon have Amazon Web Services which is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. Hence, these companies are in sought of recruiting cloud engineers. AWS also offers graduate programs for students who just finished their studies. Therefore, there are a lot of opportunities for newbies to join and learn about AWS.
 
From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).
 
For all job titles mentioned above, there are different types of skill sets needed to be applicable for working in these professions. The list of IT skills needed to work in these professions are endless. For a Business analyst, some IT skills needed are programming languages such as SQL for sorting and managing data, R for statistical analysis and Python to perform general programming. This will help in analysing big data sets. Furthermore, Business analysis is also needed. Similarly, for an IT Project manager the main IT skill set is SQL. SQL helps IT project managers to sort, analyse and manage company’s data. They also must have project management skills to be able to manage projects and bring outcomes accordingly. Skills employers search for in a Data Scientist are mainly programming languages like Python, SQL, XML and .net which is mainly for Azure developers. and software engineering which are some amongst the IT skills. For a cloud engineer, Linux and Python are very vital skill sets.
General skills are significant on the jobs that positions today require adaptability, drive and the capacity to attempt various undertakings. They are not as barely recommended and characterized as previously and they are more service oriented, making data and social abilities progressively significant. Business analyst recruiters often seek good communication, facilitation, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills. IT project managers must have Planning and forecasting, risk management and project management skills. They must also have negotiation, accountability, and leadership skills to handle any situation when doing business. Data scientists are expected to know a lot — machine learning, computer science, statistics, mathematics, data visualization, communication, and deep learning. Cloud engineers should have analytical and problem-solving skills and knowledge of how to do networking.
Three highest ranked IT skills not needed for the job titles mentioned above are Microsoft windows, graphic design and SAP.
Three highest ranked general skills not needed for the job titles mentioned above are organisational, writing and presentation skills.
Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?
Yes, having looked at the Burning Glass data, my opinion about my ideal job has changed. Looking at all the data of the job titles, I do not see any Business Analyst in that list. This gets me thinking whether I chose the right ideal job for myself. There are other similar jobs like solutions architect, software engineer, network engineer and service desk analyst on the list of job titles for Burning Glass Technologies. I am very much fond of programming and I want to work in a field where there is programming, in short, I want to use my SQL, Java and Python knowledge in my work as my bachelor’s degree is Bachelor of Business (Information Systems) and I am in my last semester. Hence, I still have time to choose my career wisely and somewhere where I can prosper and looking at the data of Burning Glass, I do not see myself becoming a Business Analyst.



# IT works
For this question, I interviewed my elder sister. She has a master's degree in IT from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. She does data analysis in the information security department of the Agricultural Bank of China. Currently engaged in information technology related work. Through the following questions, I interviewed her feelings about the IT industry and her work. Because she is more introverted and pays attention to personal privacy, so refused to record the request. But I recorded what she said and translated it into English.
1, What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
In my opinion, there are many directions in the work of the IT industry, and each direction has a different way of working.
In the direction of product, this kind of workers not only need to have good information technology, but also need to have the ability to communicate with users. They need to understand the needs of users through the conversation with users to make clear the design direction and elements of products, so as to design products that satisfy users
Technical workers need to do more professional things, including determining technical solutions and architecture. As well as the specific code development and code testing.
In the aspect of operation and maintenance in the later stage, IT personnel should continue to solve a series of operational vulnerabilities for software or web products. Compared with the technical development of some web pages and software, it is also very important for their later maintenance
 
2, What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors?
The general public?
The people we deal with include customers, investors and other IT professionals, which are determined according to different links and work directions. For example, if you are partial to the direction of products, you will deal with customers and investors, and you will communicate and discuss with other IT people when you develop specific products. The communication between IT professionals and the general public is relatively less.
 
 
3, Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?
For this question, because the IT industry has many specific branches. According to the position and direction, the time spent is also different, cannot be generalized, requirement determination, development coding, documentation and subsequent operation and maintenance will take time.
 
4, What aspect of their position is most challenging?
The most challenging aspect varies from person to person and from job to job. It may be understanding the real needs of customers and products, accumulating technology and keeping up with the rapid development of new technology, or understanding and abstracting technology. For IT professionals there are also many kinds. They all have their own fields to work in.
 
 
5, Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?
Specifically, it is to do the data analysis work of the banking industry, which belongs to the background service department and serves the business front desk. Through the analysis of transaction data and customer data, it can improve the service quality and do a good job in risk control, and also involves some development tasks.
 
6, Please tell us about the industry you work in.
The Agricultural Bank of China I work for is one of the five largest banks in China. As a traditional large enterprise, it pays more attention to security than the general small and medium-sized enterprises. We attach great importance not only to the security of customer information, but also to the security of enterprise information.
 
7, What other kinds of work do you have to do?
My job is to help front desk staff better serve customers through data analysis. Occasionally there will be development tasks assigned to me.
 
8, Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. & Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.
 
When I work, I will deal with the front desk business personnel and other developers. The purpose of dealing with the business personnel is to determine the requirements, while dealing with other developers involves the cooperation between the front desk and the background.
 
 
 9, What about your interactions with clients or investors?
As a back-end worker, I don't often deal with clients and investors.
 
10, What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.
The most time-consuming is the processing of data.
 
11, Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?
The most challenging aspect is the abstract modeling of data, which tests the combination of data, model and real-world understanding. The premise is to be familiar with the programming language of enterprise requirements. I need to use java when I work in my enterprise. But in my study career, my main learning programming languages are Python and C++. So, I also spent a lot of time learning and mastering the Java language.
 
12, Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?
The essence of the IT industry is to serve our life in a more modern and intelligent way, such as customizing personalized services for each customer and improving user experience.
 
In summary, through an interview with my sister. I learned that there are many types of jobs in the IT industry. Each type of IT worker has its own clear division of labor. It's not just programming that counts as IT type of work. Just like my sister, she was not good at communicating with customers, so she chose the backstage type of work. Although there are differences in the types of work, they are all contributing to the society through our own efforts. The competition pressure of the IT industry is very big, and workers need to maintain a high level of work and sufficient professional knowledge reserves at all times. As an IT industry worker, they need to make progress all the time to ensure that they will not be eliminated. Finally, I would like to send my sincere thanks to my sister. Be grateful to her for taking time out of her busy schedule to accept my interview.

# IT Technologies

## Autonomous vehicles
   Most people first heard about autonomous vehicles in the last 10 years. In fact, as early as the early 20th century, people began to study unmanned driving technology. The concept of an autonomous car dates back to Futurama, an exhibit at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. (Bonnie Gringer) After that, more prototypes of autonomous vehicles have been developed. These early prototypes demonstrated the technical feasibility of autonomous driving, but their high cost and low demand for such functions led to the fact that autonomous vehicles were not popular at that time. The safety and driving speed of the early autonomous vehicles were not as good as ordinary cars. In the 21st century, because all aspects of technology have been greatly developed and the U.S. government's strong interest in autonomous vehicles leads to the unprecedented development speed of driverless cars in the 21st century. After 2010, Google has launched many prototype cars of autonomous vehicles, which makes autonomous vehicles known to most people.

   Current autonomous vehicles are a kind of intelligent car. It mainly depends on the intelligent driver in the car, which is mainly based on the computer system, to help people realize the purpose of unmanned driving. They can sense the road environment through the on-board sensor system, automatically plan the driving route and control the vehicle to reach the predetermined target.
An AV is equipped with many kinds of on-board sensors such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. And so on. These devices can help the vehicle to perceive the vehicle position and obstacle information on the driving road, control the vehicle's route and speed, so that the vehicle can drive safely and reliably on the road.

A complete driverless car contains a lot of new technologies: including artificial intelligence, visual computing, automatic control and other advanced technologies in one.

The development of autonomous vehicles has entered a mature period, and it is likely to be promoted on a large scale in the next few years.

   In the next few years, because of the extensive use of 5G cellular networks. autonomous vehicles will become safer and more reliable. (market minute blog). Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on high-speed networks. Because they need to continuously transmit real-time vehicle data to them through the network to ensure that they can make the correct operation. Compared with 4G, 5G has higher speed and more stable signal. 5g network is ten times faster than the 4G network. This allows the autonomous vehicles to perceive the surrounding road conditions more quickly and accurately. In very congested highways, remote areas with poor data signal these kinds of environments, 5g network will have obvious advantages.

   With the rapid development of today's society, the pace of most people's work has become very fast. In this case, there are many new inventions that can change people's lives. Such as smartphones. It combines the functions of finding information, contacting people, entertainment and relaxation in a small smartphone. The invention of the mobile phone undoubtedly makes people's life more efficient and convenient. Autonomous vehicles are also inventions that help people improve their quality of life. Autonomous vehicles have these obvious advantages:

   Firstly, it can help people save a lot of time. The route of a driverless car is calculated by computer in real time. The computer will help car owners choose the fastest and best route. This ensures that the driver is on the best route for every trip. It avoids the time waste caused by not knowing the road when driving on a strange road. Similarly, the speed of autonomous vehicles is strictly controlled by the computer, the average speed will also be higher than that of people's autonomous driving. Therefore, through the scientific planning of the driving route by computer. Autonomous vehicles can help people save a lot of time. For parents with children, autonomous vehicles are also good news. If they have autonomous vehicles, they don't have to pick up their children in the morning and afternoon, which can be used to rest or make a cup of coffee.

   Secondly, it can help people reduce traffic accidents. The House Energy and Commerce Committee website clarifies: "Self-driving cars are projected to reduce traffic deaths by 90%, saving 30,000 lives a year." (Pete Goldin 2018) According to the USDOT website: "With 94 percent of fatal vehicle crashes attributable to human error. Many people can't make the right choice when they are driving in an emergency. This kind of wrong operation is likely to cause great losses. Even if it is not an emergency, the driver may make the wrong operation for various reasons, resulting in traffic accidents. Compared to ordinary vehicles, autonomous vehicles, through the scientific calculation of the computer, the correct operation can be made in any case. This will undoubtedly reduce the incidence of traffic accidents and protect the safety of more people.
Thirdly, it can significantly improve the driving experience of drivers, especially long-distance drivers. Drivers of ordinary vehicles need to keep their concentration at all times when driving them. If you are in an autonomous vehicle, then the driver does not need to do extra operation on the vehicle. So that you can enjoy it instead of focusing on it all the time.
   Fourthly, autonomous vehicles can reduce Co2 emissions compared to normal cars. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, autonomous vehicles can save time and reduce traffic accidents. These will reduce the possibility of traffic congestion. Plus, the computer's precise control of the car's movement. The Future of Driving report from Ohio University states: "Since software will drive the car, the modern vehicle can now be programmed to reduce emissions to the maximum extent possible. The transition to the new-age cars is expected to contribute to a 60% fall in emissions." (Pete Goldin 2018) Reducing carbon dioxide emissions means that our journey becomes more environmentally friendly. For the global sustainable development plan, this technology is undoubtedly good news.

  For autonomous vehicles, the biggest competitor is traditional cars. The idea of driverless vehicles is to achieve the goal of driverless mainly relying on the intelligent driver with a computer system in the vehicle. But traditional cars need someone to drive them. If autonomous vehicles are widely launched in the future, it is likely to hit the existing traditional automobile industry. There may be a lot of people who give up choosing traditional cars and choose autonomous vehicles.
   For me, I'm not in a rush to choose a driverless car. At present, there are still some hidden dangers in autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicle is operated by the computer system's time operation. These systems are vulnerable to deliberate attacks. The specific targets of these attacks are to interfere with AI systems and destroy key safety functions. (Help net security, 02/17/2017). Secondly, autonomous vehicles have no way to deal with many emergencies. Therefore, the safety of autonomous vehicles still needs to be further improved. If autonomous vehicles have made great progress in safety in the future, then I will consider choosing autonomous vehicles.

# Cybersecurity

   PC security, cybersecurity, or data innovation security (IT security) is the insurance of PC frameworks and organizations from data exposure, robbery of or harm to their equipment, programming, or electronic information, just as from the interruption or confusion of the servers they give. A cybersecurity analyst can only work for cybersecurity. These Cybersecurity analyst experts (additionally called data security investigators) plan and complete safety efforts to ensure an organization's PC organizations and frameworks, as indicated by the Bureau of Labour Statistics BLS (Malvik, 2020). They keep steady tabs on dangers and screen their association's organizations for any breaks in security. The field is becoming increasingly significant due to the increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the "Internet of things". There are heaps of ways hackers can use and adapt even the most harmless data. Through identity theft, capturing tax refunds or in any event, taking health care coverage for clinical service, cyber criminals come up with all sorts of creative ways to profit from information most people don’t take sufficient lengths to protect. This makes everyone a target. Owing to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world. Cyber Security is not dying anytime soon as long as people have access to the internet and have an inspirational perspective as a vocation at present and for what's to come. Fundamentally because of increased attention to digital dangers and assaults, particularly after prominent digital assaults, just as intense deficiencies to fulfill the need for network protection experts.

   The cybersecurity field can be separated into a few distinct areas, the coordination of which within the association is crucial to the achievement of an online protection program. These areas incorporate the following:

### 1.Information or data security
### 2.Network security
### 3.Disaster recovery/business continuity planning
### 4.Operational security
### 5.oud security
### 6.Critical infrastructure security
### 7.Physical security
### 8..End-user education

   Keeping up online protection in a continually advancing danger scene is a test for all organizations. Conventional receptive methodologies, in which assets were set toward securing frameworks against the greatest known dangers, while lesser realized dangers were undefended, is not, at this point, an adequate strategy. To stay aware of changing security hazards, a more proactive and versatile methodology is important. A few key network protection warning associations offer direction. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends adopting continuous monitoring and real-time assessments as part of a risk assessment framework to defend against known and unknown threats (Shea, 2019). The benefits of implementing and maintaining cybersecurity practices include:
   
### 1.Business insurance against cyberattacks and information breaks.
### 2.Security for information and organizations.
### 3.Prevention of unapproved client access.
### 4.Improved recuperation time after a breach.
### 5.Insurance for end clients and endpoint gadgets.
### 6.Administrative consistency.
### 7.Business coherence.
### 8.Improved trust in the organization's reputation and trust for engineers, shareholders, clients, partners, and workers.

   Cybersecurity is consistently being challenged by hackers, data loss, privacy, risk management and changing cybersecurity strategies. The quantity of cyberattacks is not expected to diminish in the coming years. In addition, increased entry points for attacks, for example, with the intervention of the Internet of Things (IoT), increase the need to secure organizations and data frameworks.
   Perhaps the most dangerous component of cybersecurity is the developing idea of safety hazards. As new technologies arise, and as innovation is utilized in new or various manners, new assault roads are created. Staying aware of these successive changes and advances in attacks, as well as updating practices to protect against them, can be challenging. Issues incorporating guaranteeing all components of cybersecurity are safe, must continually update to secure against possible weaknesses. This can be particularly hard for more smaller companies without the staff or in-house assets.

## Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
### WHAT DOES IT DO?
 
   Blockchain technology is a kind of technical solution that does not rely on a third party and carries out network data storage, verification, transmission and exchange through its own distributed nodes. Therefore, from the perspective of financial accounting, some people regard blockchain technology as a distributed, open and decentralized large network ledger book. Anyone can use the same technical standards to add their own information at any time, extend the blockchain, and continuously meet the data entry needs brought by various demands. Blockchain technology is a way for all people to participate in bookkeeping. All systems have a database, which you can think of as one big ledger. So who keeps the ledger becomes very important. In a blockchain system, everyone in the system has the opportunity to participate in bookkeeping. In a certain period of time if there is any data change, everyone in the system can come to the bookkeeping, the system will judge the fastest and best bookkeeping during this period of time, write his recorded content into the book, and the book content will be sent to all other people in the system for backup. So everybody in the system has a complete ledger. In this way, we call it blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is considered to be the supporting technology to build the future "Internet of trust" and "Internet of value". Now, the application field of blockchain technology has gone beyond the financial field, and gradually carried out practice in supply chain, credit investigation, identity authentication, public welfare, the Internet of Things and other fields.
   
   In February 2018, the US House of Representatives held two consecutive blockchain hearings to explore new applications of blockchain technology. The U.S. State Department has emphasized that increased transparency through blockchain technology can address corruption, fraud, or misappropriation of public procurement funds. And also, New York State power company Transactive Grid proposed the new energy concept of P2P distributed micro power network based on block chain. It established the micro Grid network through block chain, improved the utilization rate of clean energy, and recorded the remaining electricity on the block chain and sold it to the neighbor users through smart contracts.
Blockchain technology will be able to automate a lot of manual operation, manual verification and approval work in the future. Paper contracts will be replaced by smart contracts, and there will no longer be losses caused by system failures in transaction processing.
 
   Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange that uses cryptographic principles to secure transactions and control the creation of trading units. Bitcoin became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009, and since then the term cryptocurrency has been used to refer to such designs and also Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain. The Bitcoin peer-to-peer network stores all transaction history on the "blockchain."
Blockchains continue to grow, and once new blocks are added to the blockchain, they cannot be removed.Blockchain is actually a group of decentralized client nodes and a distributed database composed of all participants, which is a record of the history of all Bitcoin transactions. A transaction is preliminarily confirmed when bitcoin transaction data is packaged into a "data block" or "block." The transaction is further confirmed when the block is linked to the previous block. After six block confirmations in a row, the deal is essentially irrevocably confirmed. As of July 2019, there were more than 2,600 cryptocurrencies in circulation.New cryptocurrencies can be created by anyone at any time, with more functionality, better privacy protection, faster block generation times, support for smart contracts, different algorithms and consensus mechanisms, etc...

### WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?
 
   The development of blockchain has many implications. Firstly, it helps build a credit system. Once the blockchain technology is mature, the existence of the notary office is of little significance. A person's credit record in the bank and other institutions cannot be tampered with. Law enforcement agencies can easily confirm whether what the parties say is true through the blockchain technology, without a lot of energy and a long time of investigation. Secondly, in the transaction payment, due to the transaction distrust problem, the future use of blockchain technology, the money transaction between the two sides of the fund receiving and receiving will be completed completely point-to-point quickly, without ambiguity. Cross-border transactions will be easier and safer in the future, but life will be harder for intermediaries of all kinds, and even the types of cross-border crimes will be much less frequent. Secondly, the problem of false identity is also solved. In the future, blockchain technology will make it easy for counterfeiters to hide. Your data will be able to be accurately tracked as long as it is authorized, but it will be harder to change.
   
   However, the application of blockchain technology also faces many difficulties. Bitcoin is the first successful application of blockchain technology. Up to now, the Bitcoin blockchain system has been in operation for more than 8 years. Except for a few limited forks, there has been no major security accident, which fully shows its strong stability and security. At present, the application of blockchain technology is still mostly concentrated in the financial field, such as digital currency, cross-border payment, securities trading, property registration and authentication, etc. However, there are still many problems to be solved before it can be widely applied in the financial field in the future. Such as, cryptocurrencies be restricted by current idea, system, law. The characteristics of blockchain decentralization, self-management and collective maintenance subvert people's current way of production and life, dilute the concept of state and supervision, and impact the existing legal arrangements. Secondly, in terms of technology, blockchain still needs to make a breakthrough. For example, the block capacity problem. Since the block chain needs to carry all the information generated before copying, the information in the next block will be larger than the information in the previous block. If passed on like this, the information written in the block will increase infinitely, which will bring about information storage, verification and capacity problems to be solved.
    
### HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?
 
   The application of more blockchain technology will change my daily life. I probably don't need a lot of personal certification. The tampering nature of the blockchain fundamentally changes this situation. Birth certificates, house ownership certificates and marriage certificates can all be notarized on the blockchain and become something that is trusted globally. Travel consumption is more convenient. We often use apps to find hotels and other services, and the platforms get a cut of that. Blockchain applications are designed to remove intermediaries and create a secure, decentralized way for service providers and customers to connect and transact directly. 
  
## Cloud computing
### What does it do?
   Cloud computing or technology, also called cloud, is changing our way to save and share information. People are using Cloud technology everyday even they do not know.
So what is Cloud technology? Cloud computing is the delivery of many services through the Internet. Services include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software(FRANKENFIELD,2020).
    And why were we called it Cloud? Because the information served to users is located in a virtual place. It means users do not have to access information in a specific place, Cloud can help you access the information you need anywhere and anytime. Cloud is most used in store information.
      
   Saving and sharing is the basic use,Cloud computing is potential. Its ability can provide more convenience. For personal use, Cloud can reduce some of the hardware stress to people who need data in any device and travel anywhere. Also Cloud technology can promote productivity,speed and efficiency(FRANKENFIELD,2020).For example, we are using many email applications, like gmail,outlook. And we are using online files. For example, google drive,onedrive. Those applications facilitate our using, and saving our hardware cost.  For corporations, cloud can collect and process data from users, that help companies to adjust their products and stock according to the latest customer needs through the development modules provided by the cloud computing platform. Many companies  are using cloud for better service for customers. For example, some corporations like Siri from Apple,Cortana from Microsoft, Alexa from Amazon and Google assistant from Google.Those corporations created some Artificial intelligence to improve customer using experience.Cloud computing helps companies to know what customers need, and also make plans to make more profit for their companies. For government, Cloud can be used in government portal website  construction,government application system construction,government data construction and other places. Cloud computing will promote the development of networks,and improve the development of technology. For example, the government can use cloud computing to get information to plan resources using, adjust economic strategy and transportation management.
   
   Cloud computing is a potential technology. As I mentioned before, cloud can save and share information without physical constraints and time constraints.Also it will reduce the stress of hardware. It means you can use it anywhere.This technology is used in gaming in recent years. For example, Stadia from Google,xcloud from Microsoft.Cloud games is on its way now. How does it work ? The main technologies used in cloud games include screen rendering in the cloud, and streaming media transmission technology between the player terminal and the cloud.  In the cloud game scenario, the game does not run in the player's game terminal, but in the cloud server, and the cloud server renders the game scene into a video and audio stream, which is transmitted to the player's game terminal through the network. It means it can save money on gaming equipment for gamers.For many high quality games that require long-term updates, cloud games can also reduce the cost of publishing and maintaining games. It sounds so nice, thank you cloud. But compared to normal games, it has shortcomings. Firstly, cloud games are based on the internet, game interaction delay depends on network communication delay. Compared with traditional online games, cloud games are more sensitive to the network delay. When the quality of the network is not good,players will directly feel the high delay in the game, thus significantly reducing the quality of game experience for players. Secondly,The multimedia streaming quality of game scene rendering depends on the network communication bandwidth.Compared with traditional online games, the multimedia stream of cloud games consumes more bandwidth, and if you want to play games with high image quality, it means you need a high speed bandwidth.
   
   Artificial intelligence is always a controversial technology. Cloud and artificial intelligence have close relationships. Artificial intelligence and cloud computing can work together to become AI cloud computing.What is AI cloud computing?   AI cloud computing is the merging of the machine learning capabilities of artificial intelligence with cloud-based computing environments, making intuitive, connected experiences possible. For example, you can find AI assistants Siri, Amazon Alexa combine a seamless flow of artificial intelligence technology and cloud-based computing resources to help people to make purchases,adjust thermostat and find your favourite song. The combination of AI and cloud computing is changing the world. Firstly, AI can change the experience of users.It means users can get high-quality services. AI cloud computing will know customers very well,because it can catch data from users,it means AI can be helpful with different people. Secondly,Artificial intelligence is being used in boring ,repetitive,complicated missions. That will promote productivity efficiently.

### What is the likely impact?
   
   As I mentioned before, cloud computing is related to saving and sharing, and saving and sharing functions are related to security. Because of cloud technology, cybersecurity will become an important place. The famous privacy loophole of  facebook  remains that we should take care of  cloud saving and sharing.And servers should provide privacy policy.Because privacy is very important to ourselves,every one of us should be respected. How to protect information correctly from stealing,privacy invasion is being a problem.
   
   As I mentioned before, cloud computing in gaming is potential, so  hardware and software effects will be a part of it. Even though cloud computing is not totally mature, we can see its function is very prominent. Especially saving and sharing. The hardware,software developments direction might be affected by cloud technology,and many hardware corporations will be affected. People who are affected by cloud computing might be hardware designers,software designers and users, if the situation changes, they have to learn something new techniques or change the direction of development. For users, we can enjoy a better life through new technology, and for gamers, they might have better experiences because of cloud technology.
   
   As I mentioned earlier, Al computing is potential and powerful in the serving industry. It can reduce the cost of serving and improve productivity. People whose jobs are related to serving may have a change. Because manpower is replaced by powerful machine productivity.
